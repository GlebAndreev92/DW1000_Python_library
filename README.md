# DW1000 Python Library for Raspberry Pi

This module provides functions allowing the use of the DW1000 chip with a Raspberry Pi using Python scripts, as presented in [this tutorial]. It is an adaptation in Python language of the [arduino-dw1000] library. 
This chip embeds Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology which can be used for message transmissions and more commonly, ranging functionality.
